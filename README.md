BlackSCREENremote is an android remotec control that controlls a server on the computer. The sever has no action, except when the remote control sended a command, so that the server creates an event by using java robot class. The differece to other remote controls is that this uses the volume buttons and the screen is off all the time. So this remote control saves energy and can run on a phone for about 10 hours(tested on galaxy s3). Also the server is in java and so very simple to handle by the user. Just connect the phone and the computer by androids wlan hotspot, enter ip address, press start on both the android phone and the server. Finish!
